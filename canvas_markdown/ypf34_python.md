Python is an open source [0] programming language and can be used from programming and data science.

>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. 
It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. [1]

You can download Python [2] for Windows, Linux or MacOS, but you can also run in it an browser within the VU with JupyterHub [3], so it can work on all systems with a modern web browser (like a smart phone, smart TV or ChromeBook).
